**************IMPORTANT******************
IMPT1-->

If we delete a file from out directory and commit that change, then we can restore that file
step 1--> first we have to copy the previous commit link
step 2 --> git reset prev_git_command
step 3--> git restore file_name
file will be restored

IMPT2-->
git remote add origin link-Of-GitHub-Repo
remote means working with URl's
add means adding the url
**origin --> Name of the url (similar to the name we have while saving a phone nos, we don't remember phone no we remember 
naem), by default all the name of the Repository URl's in the personal Git-Hub starts with *origin*
