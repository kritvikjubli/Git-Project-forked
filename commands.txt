History of deleted (means the file should be commmited) file should be saved in out .git directory, only then we can restore it 


If we delete a file from our directory and commit that change, then we can restore that file
step 1 --> first we have to commit the change of deleting the file
step 2 --> then we have to copy the previous commit link
step 3 --> git reset prev_git_command
step 4 --> git restore file_name
file will be restored

git remote add origin link-Of-GitHub-Repo
remote means working with URl's
add means adding the url
**origin --> Name of the url (similar to the name we have while saving a phone nos, we don't remember phone no we remember 
name), by default all the name of the Repository URl's in the personal Git-Hub starts with *origin*

Histroy of project is saved inside .git directory
Inside .git folder there is head.

Q. what is a HEAD?
ANS-> HEAD is basically a pointer which points to the branch where the commit should be stored
